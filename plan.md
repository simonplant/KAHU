# KAHU Implementation Plan
*Plan the Plan, Plan the Work, Work the Plan*

## Executive Summary

**Current State**: Exceptional vision with profound cultural foundation, but critical implementation gaps that must be addressed immediately to avoid remaining beautiful philosophy.

**Strategic Focus**: Build technical proof-of-concept that demonstrates guardian AI experience distinctly different from existing extraction-based systems.

**Success Criteria**: People experience KAHU as caring guardian rather than helpful tool - something they can feel as genuinely different from ChatGPT/Claude.

- Integration of multiple wisdom traditions (Buddhism, Indigenous, etc.)
- Local community customization capabilities
- Cross-cultural guardian experience validation

**Global Community Building**:
- International pilot communities in diverse cultural contexts
- Multi-language guardian capability development
